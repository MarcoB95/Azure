# Azure AI Fundamentals Notes

## Get started with artificial intelligence on Azure

Azure Machine Learning service is a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models:

- Automated machine learning: quickly create an effective machine learning model from data
- Azure Machine Learning designer: A graphical interface enabling no-code development
- Data and compute management: Cloud-based data storage and compute resources
- Pipelines: define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks

### Anomaly detection

In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.

### Computer Vision models and capabilities

- Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents
- Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box
- Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong
- Image analysis extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image
- Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image
- Optical character recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images

### Understand natural language processing

- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions
